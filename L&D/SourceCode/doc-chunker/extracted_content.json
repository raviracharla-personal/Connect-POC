    "content": "If required a user, typically the Investigations OIC, can request that the Investigation \nclassification is amended from the Request Reclassification Linked Actions on the \nWorkload tab. \nOnce the OIC has submitted the request, NEC Connect raises a workflow task to the \nrelevant authorisation unit(s) based on the new requested classification to approve the \nrequest. If an approval unit has not been defined for the new classification, type the task \nis raised for the default approval unit. \nNote \nAn Investigation cannot be amended from a CRIME to a NON-CRIME. \n \nNote \nWhen defining the reclassification routes the System Administrator can optionally associate a \nsecurity permission with the task. This means that users who don't have that permission will not \nbe able to perform the reclassification request. \nThe following steps describe how to request an Investigation re-classification: \n1. From the Workload tab, select the required Investigation and click Linked \nActions. \n2. Select Request Reclassification. \n\n--- Image: p79_i0.png ---\n\n \nThe Request Reclassification card index is displayed. \n \n3.

Provide any supporting information. \n6. Click Return to Cards. \nThe Card Index is displayed, all cards have a status of Complete. \n7. Click Submit & Continue or Submit & Exit.. \nThe request is submitted to the authorising unit for approval. \nOnce a reclassification request has been sent by the OIC it has to be approved by the \nrelevant authorisation unit(s), this based on the new requested classification. A Process \nReclassification Request task is raised for the approval unit(s) and appears in the units \nWorkload tab. Once the first unit has approved the reclassification request an approval \ntask is raised for the next approval unit and so on until all approvals are sought. If any \nunit rejects the request an acknowledge rejection task is raised for the OIC. \nNote \nThe approval path is configured by the forces system administrators per classification type. If no \napproval path exists for classification type the Process Reclassification Request task is raised for \nthe default approval unit. \n  \nThe following steps describe how to complete the Process Reclassification Request task: \n1.

Click Submit. \nIf the reclassification request has been Accepted a Process Reclassification task is \nraised for the next approval unit.

    "content": "During an investigation, victims and victim organisations, will need to be kept informed \nabout the progress of the investigation. A record of the contact made should be recorded \nin NEC Connect. \nKeeping victims and victim organisations updated is essential. Obligations with regard to \ncontacting victims during an investigation are outlined in The Code of Practice for Victims \nof Crime and the Witness Charter. \nBefore providing an update to a victim in NEC Connect, the investigation should have at \nleast one victim or victim organisation. The updates provided to the victim and victim \norganisations are added in the Contact Log tab for the victim.  \nNEC Connect automatically triggers an Update Victim task (if there is a victim on the \nInvestigation) for the OIC under the following circumstances: \n \n    \nPage 126 of \n• When an OIC is allocated or changed \n• When a suspect is arrested or charged \n• When a suspect is bailed or their bail is changed \nIf the OIC does not perform the Update Victim task within X days, the OIC is notified by \nmeans of a chaser task. If the Update Victim task is not completed within Y days, \nNEC Connect raises an escalation task to the OIC's Supervisor. \nThe Update Victim task will only be raised when the investigation has the following \nstatuses: \n• Requires Assessment/Review \n• Under Investigation \n• Requires Allocation \n• Requires Further Information \nAd-hoc updates can also be added by performing the Record Victim Update action \navailable from the Linked Actions button. \n15.5.1. Victim contract \nA victim contract can be defined in NEC Connect for any victim involved in an \ninvestigation. This is recorded on the Victim Code and Information tab of the person \nwho has been added to the investigation as a victim or the Victim Code tab for a victim \norganisation. \nThe contract shows in what circumstances, and how, the victim should be contacted. For \nexample, the contract may specify that a victim must be contacted by telephone when \nan OIC is allocated to the investigation or when a suspect is arrested or charged. The \nmaximum number of days between regular victim updates must also be specified; the \nOIC Update Involved Parties task is automatically raised at the specified intervals. The \nnumber of days between regular victim updates depends on the type of service chosen \nby the victim. The following types of services are available for the victim: \n• Opt in Full Service - Standard Victim - Update within 5 working days \n• Opt in Full Service - Priority Victim - Update within 1 working days \n• Unknown - Victim contract not yet agreed must be updated within 5 days \nThe following types of services are available for a victim organisation: \n• Opt in - Business Victim \n• Unknown - Victim contract not yet agreed must be updated within 5 days \nVictims can also choose to opt out of regular updates, if required. \n15.5.2. Record victim updates \nThe following steps describe how to record an update given to a victim, they assume \nthat a person or organisation has already been added as a victim. \n1. In the Workload tab, click My Unit, and then under the Investigation panel, \nselect the required investigation. \nThe investigation is displayed. \n2. Click Linked Actions. \nThe Linked Actions dialog box is displayed. \n3. Click Record Victim Update. \nThe Record Victim Update card is displayed. \n \n    \nPage 127 of \n4. Select the Reason for update from the drop-down menu. \n\n--- Image: p128_i0.png ---\n\n \n5. Select the Method of update. \nIf SMS is selected: \n• Select the relevant mobile number to send the SMS to. \nNote \nThe forces system administrator is required to enable the SMS functionality via a System \nParameter before NEC Connect will send an SMS. The content of the SMS is made up of a \nsystem defined prefix followed by the contents of the Details field. \n9. Enter the details of the update in Details. \n10. Click Return to Cards. \nThe Record Victim Update card is marked as Complete. The recorded victim \nupdate is saved."

Other \nusers with the right permissions can also register an interest, either as the interested \nstaff member or unit or on behalf of another staff member or unit.  \nUsers register an interest in an investigation by initiating a Register Interested Party \nlinked action and an interest can be removed by initiating a Complete Interest In \nInvestigation linked action. \nIn certain circumstances, NEC Connect may automatically register a person's or unit's \ninterest in an investigation. \nTwo things happen automatically when a staff member or unit registers an interest in an \napplication: \n• A new interest is recorded for the officer. \nThe interest identifies the staff member or unit, the reason for the interest (if \ngiven) and the start date. \n• An Interest In Investigation holding task appears on the staff member's or unit's \nWorkload tab. \nThe presence of this holding task merely acts as a reminder to check the progress \nof the investigation from time to time. \nA staff member or unit can have at most one current registered interest in a particular \ninvestigation. An investigation can have any number of registered interests. \nA current registered interest can be transferred to another staff member or unit by \nmeans of the Transfer Interest In Investigation linked action. For example, a unit with an \nregistered interest may want to transfer the interest to a particular staff member. In \neffect, the current interest is ended and a new interest is started. \nRegistered interests may remain in place after the investigation status has been set to \nFILED.
