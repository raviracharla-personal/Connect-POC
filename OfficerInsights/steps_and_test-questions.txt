Pre-requistes:
Node v22.18.0
Python v3.13.5

API need this:
Manual FFmpeg Installation (The Safe Way)
This is the only prerequisite. It does not use Chocolatey and is entirely self-contained.
Download: Go to https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ and download the ffmpeg-release-full.7z file from the release builds.
Extract: Use a tool like 7-Zip to extract the archive. You will get a folder like ffmpeg-6.1.1-full_build.
Place it: Create a folder named C:\ffmpeg and move the extracted folder into it. Your ffmpeg.exe will now be at C:\ffmpeg\ffmpeg-6.1.1-full_build\bin\ffmpeg.exe.
Add to PATH:
Press the Windows Key, type env, and select "Edit the system environment variables".
Click "Environment Variables...".
Under "User variables", select the Path variable and click "Edit...".
Click "New" and paste the path to the bin folder: C:\ffmpeg\ffmpeg-6.1.1-full_build\bin.
Click OK on all windows.
Verify: Close and reopen all terminal windows (including VS Code's terminal). In a new terminal, run ffmpeg -version. If you see version info, it is working.

# Requirements:
ePNB (Electronic Pocket Notebook ) - a chat interface that can process natural language entries (via voice or keyboard), establish intent, identify entities, handle relationships between them (like a Driver and their Vehicle), and structure the output.

1. positive flow with all details
1. positive flow - input having only 'today' (without date) - failing earlier, hallucinating date, fixed now
2. 

Issues faced:
---------------
1. gpt-4o-mini not good for entity extraction. sometimes work, and sometimes doesn't. 
2. need to do post-processing to handle schema validation, handle date like today, yesterday, etc, which is not handled by prompt efficiently
3. speech: when I say 'TOR', it transcribe as 'tour'. they sound identitical. Without context, the speech service will almost always default to the more common English word, "tour". Solution: use phrase list, it is basically the domain specific words and acronyms that you give to the speech recognizer. When the service hears audio that could be "TOR" or "tour", it will see "TOR" on your list and give it a much higher probability of being the correct transcription.


Pending:
-----------
1. get cost for gpt-4o-mini vs gpt-4.1
2. cross-verify solution with the requirements


#Issues with browser's built-in Web Speech API:  its accuracy is highly inconsistent across different accents, browsers, and operating systems.
Solution: server-side speech-to-text service. Use "Azure Speech to Text". It is a world-class service specifically designed to handle multiple languages and a wide variety of accents with extremely high accuracy.
